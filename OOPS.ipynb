        "\n",
        "1.  What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        " - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code using objects, which are instances of classes. A class acts as a blueprint for creating objects and can contain attributes (data) and methods (functions that operate on the data). The main idea behind OOP is to model real-world entities as objects to make code more reusable, modular, and easier to maintain. It focuses on encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        " - A class is like a blueprint or template used to create objects in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Just like you need an architectural design to build a house, in the same way, you need a class to create objects. It defines what data (attributes) an object will have and what actions (methods) it can perform.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        " - In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), an object is a real-world entity created from a class. Think of a class as a template or design, and the object as the actual thing made using that design. For example, if Car is a class, then my_car = Car(\"BMW\", \"X5\") is an object. This object has real values and can perform actions defined in the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        " - Abstraction is the process of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features to the user. It helps in reducing code complexity and increasing efficiency by letting users focus on what the object does rather than how it does it. In Python, abstraction is achieved using abstract classes and methods (from abc module).\n",
        "\n",
        "     Encapsulation is the process of binding data and related methods together into a single unit, usually a class, and restricting direct access to some components of an object. This is done by making variables private and accessing them using getters and setters. It helps in protecting data and ensures security.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        " - Dunder methods (short for \"double underscore methods\") are special predefined methods in Python that start and end with double underscores — like __init__, __str__, __len__, etc. These methods are also called magic methods or special methods, and they allow you to define how your objects should behave with built-in Python operations — such as printing, addition, comparison, and more.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        " - Inheritance is one of the core concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It allows a class (child class) to inherit properties and methods from another class (parent class). This helps in code reusability, and also in creating a hierarchy between classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        " - Polymorphism in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) means “many forms.” It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. The key idea is that the same operation or method can behave differently on different classes. In simpler words, polymorphism lets you use a single interface to represent different underlying data types or methods, so the exact behavior depends on the actual object type at runtime. For example, if you have a method named draw(), different shapes like circles, squares, and triangles can have their own version of draw(). When you call draw() on any shape object, the right version runs based on the shape’s type — that’s polymorphism in action.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "  - Encapsulation in Python is the practice of hiding the internal details of an object and restricting direct access to its data. This is typically done by using naming conventions like a single underscore (_) to indicate protected members and double underscores (__) for private members, which helps prevent accidental modification from outside the class. Instead of accessing variables directly, access is controlled through methods, often called getters and setters, allowing validation or controlled updates. Encapsulation helps protect an object’s internal state, promotes modularity, and makes the code easier to maintain and less prone to errors by keeping the implementation details hidden from the outside world.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        " - A constructor in Python is a special method within a class that is automatically called when a new object of that class is created. Its main purpose is to initialize the object’s attributes with default or user-provided values, setting up the initial state of the object. In Python, the constructor method is named __init__(), and it can accept parameters to customize the creation of each object. Using constructors makes it easier to create objects with specific properties right from the start, ensuring that the object is ready to use immediately after instantiation.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        " - lass methods and static methods in Python are two special types of methods within a class that serve different purposes compared to regular instance methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "     A class method is a method that receives the class itself as the first argument, usually named cls, instead of an instance. It is defined using the @classmethod decorator. Class methods can access and modify class-level attributes and are often used for factory methods or operations that affect the class as a whole rather than any single object.\n",
        "\n",
        "     A static method, on the other hand, does not receive an implicit first argument—neither the instance (self) nor the class (cls). It is defined with the @staticmethod decorator. Static methods behave like regular functions but belong to the class’s namespace. They are useful for utility functions related to the class but that don’t need to access or modify class or instance data.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        " - Method overloading is a concept where multiple methods in the same class share the same name but differ in the number or types of their parameters. This allows the same method name to perform different tasks based on the input arguments. However, unlike some other programming languages like Java or C++, Python does not support method overloading directly. In Python, if multiple methods with the same name are defined, the last one will override the previous ones.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        " - Method overriding in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) occurs when a subclass provides its own specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent (super) class. This means the subclass’s version of the method replaces or “overrides” the behavior of the method inherited from the parent class. It allows a subclass to customize or extend the behavior of methods to suit its own needs while keeping the same method name and interface.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        " - A property decorator in Python is a special built-in decorator @property that allows you to define methods in a class that behave like attributes. It provides a way to customize access to instance variables by defining getter, setter, and deleter methods, but lets you use simple attribute access syntax instead of explicitly calling methods. This helps in controlling how an attribute’s value is accessed or modified while keeping the interface clean and intuitive.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        " - Polymorphism is important in Object-Oriented Programming because it allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. This means a single interface or method can work with different types of objects, enabling flexibility and extensibility in code. It helps in writing more generic and reusable code, where the exact behavior can vary depending on the object’s actual class, but the same method call works seamlessly across different types. This leads to easier maintenance, better organization, and the ability to extend functionality without changing existing code.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        " - An abstract class in Python is a special kind of class that cannot be instantiated on its own and is meant to be a blueprint for other classes. It defines a common interface with one or more abstract methods that must be implemented by any subclass that inherits from it. Abstract classes are used to enforce certain methods in derived classes, ensuring they follow a particular structure. This concept helps in designing a clear and consistent architecture, where the abstract class provides shared functionality or method signatures, but leaves the specific details to be defined by subclasses. In Python, abstract classes are created using the abc module and the @abstractmethod decorator.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        " - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) offers several key advantages that make software development more efficient and organized. First, it promotes modularity by breaking down a program into smaller, manageable pieces called objects, which represent real-world entities. This modularity makes code easier to understand, develop, and maintain. Second, OOP supports code reusability through inheritance, allowing new classes to reuse properties and methods from existing ones, saving time and effort. Third, it enhances data security and integrity by encapsulating data within objects, controlling access through methods, and hiding the internal state from outside interference. Fourth, OOP enables flexibility and scalability because objects and classes can be extended or modified without affecting the entire system. Lastly, polymorphism allows different objects to be treated uniformly through common interfaces, simplifying code and improving maintainability. Overall, OOP helps in building robust, reusable, and scalable software systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        " - A class variable is a variable that is shared among all instances of a class. It is defined inside the class but outside any instance methods. Because it belongs to the class itself, any change to a class variable affects all instances that access it. Class variables are used when you want to maintain a value that is common to every object created from that class.\n",
        "\n",
        "     An instance variable, on the other hand, is unique to each object (instance) of the class. It is usually defined inside methods like the constructor (__init__) and holds data specific to that particular instance. Changes made to an instance variable affect only that specific object, not others.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        " - Multiple inheritance in Python is a feature where a class can inherit attributes and methods from more than one parent class. This means a single child class can have multiple base classes, allowing it to combine and reuse functionality from all those parent classes. Multiple inheritance helps in creating complex behaviors by mixing capabilities from different classes, but it can also lead to challenges like the “diamond problem,” where the method resolution order (MRO) decides which parent’s method to use when there are conflicts. Python handles this with a well-defined MRO to avoid ambiguity.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python.\n",
        " - The __str__ and __repr__ methods in Python are special dunder methods used to define how objects of a class are represented as strings, but they serve slightly different purposes.\n",
        "\n",
        "     __str__ is intended to provide a readable, user-friendly string representation of an object. It is used when you print an object or use str() on it. This method should return a concise and clear description that is easy for end-users to understand.\n",
        "\n",
        "     __repr__, on the other hand, is meant to provide an official string representation of the object that is more detailed and unambiguous. Its goal is to provide enough information to recreate the object if needed. This representation is used mainly for debugging and development, and when you type the object directly in the Python shell or call repr() on it.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
        " - The super() function in Python is used to give access to methods from a parent or superclass inside a subclass. Its main significance is to allow a subclass to call and extend the behavior of its parent class without explicitly naming it, which makes the code more maintainable and supports multiple inheritance properly. Using super(), you can invoke the parent class’s methods (like constructors or other functions) to reuse code, avoid duplication, and ensure that the parent class is properly initialized or its methods are correctly executed before or after adding extra functionality in the subclass. This helps in building cleaner, more organized, and easier-to-manage object-oriented programs.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        " - The __del__ method in Python is a special method known as a destructor. Its significance lies in being automatically called when an object is about to be destroyed or garbage collected. This method allows you to define cleanup actions, such as releasing external resources (like files or network connections), closing database connections, or performing other finalization tasks before the object is removed from memory. However, relying heavily on __del__ is generally discouraged because its execution timing is not guaranteed, and Python’s garbage collector may delay or skip calling it in certain cases, especially with circular references. Therefore, it’s often better to manage resource cleanup explicitly using context managers or other mechanisms.\n",
        "\n",
        "22.  What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        " - The main difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python lies in what they receive as their first argument and how they are used within a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "         @staticmethod:\n",
        "\n",
        "         A static method does not receive any special first argument like self or cls. It behaves like a regular function but belongs to the class’s namespace. It cannot access or modify the class state or instance state. Static methods are used when you want to group a function logically within a class, but the function does not depend on the class or instance itself.\n",
        "\n",
        "         @classmethod:\n",
        "\n",
        "         A class method receives the class itself as the first argument, conventionally named cls. It can access and modify class state that applies across all instances. Class methods are often used for factory methods or methods that affect the class as a whole rather than individual instances.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        " - Polymorphism in Python with inheritance means that a child class can have its own version of a method that is already defined in its parent class, and when you call that method on an object, Python automatically uses the child class’s version instead of the parent’s. This allows the same method name to behave differently depending on the object’s actual class, enabling flexible and reusable code.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        " - Method chaining in Python OOP is a programming technique where multiple methods are called sequentially on the same object in a single line of code. Each method in the chain returns the object itself (usually by returning self), allowing the next method to be called directly on that same object without needing to write the object’s name repeatedly.\n",
        "\n",
        "     This style makes the code more concise and readable, especially when you want to perform a series of operations on the same object. It’s commonly used in classes where you want to apply multiple modifications or configurations step-by-step.\n",
        "\n",
        "25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        " - The __call__ method in Python allows an instance of a class to be called like a regular function. When you define the __call__ method inside a class, you can use the object itself followed by parentheses () to invoke that method, just like calling a function. This can be useful to make objects behave like functions, enabling more flexible and intuitive interfaces."
